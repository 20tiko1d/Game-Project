tutorial1 = Welcome to tutorial! The goal of this game is to find object pairs and to get out of the labyrinth. The score drops with time everywhere except near objects. Connecting pairs gives more points.
tutorial2 = Each object has a sentence in it and your job is to find the object pairs which have the same sentence. You can have only one object active at the time. There is also one extra object which does not have a pair.
tutorial3 = In every labyrinth, there is this kind of a square. It marks the middle point between the start and the exit.
tutorial4 = This object has a different sentence, so we are going to keep searching for other objects and at the same time look for the exit.
tutorial5 = There is the exit, but you will need to connect at least one object pair in order to get out of the labyrinth.
tutorial6 = This object has the same sentence as the one we just encountered. We can switch the active object to this.
tutorial7 = You can increase your character's speed by holding down the boost button, but your view range will shrink.
tutorial8 = In order to connect the objects, you must first activate one object and then validate the other. If you validate the wrong object, you will lose points.
